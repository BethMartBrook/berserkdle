            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Berserkdle! This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information when you use our game. Since Berserkdle operates entirely within your web browser, we want to be transparent about how your data is stored and used.</p>
            <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy applies only to information we collect in this game.</p>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Berserkdle uses your browser's local storage to enhance your gameplay experience. This storage is specific to your device and browser. We collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Your current game state, completed puzzles, and statistics</li>
                <li><strong>Game History:</strong> Records of your previous game sessions</li>
                <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or IP address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All data is stored using the browser's <span class="highlight">localStorage</span> technology, which keeps data on your device.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Data Storage & Security</h2>
            <p>Your game data is stored exclusively in your browser's <span class="highlight">localStorage</span>. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is stored on your device only</li>
                <li>Data persists between browser sessions</li>
                <li>Data is not transmitted to any external servers</li>
                <li>Data is specific to the browser and device you use</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While localStorage is generally secure, note that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data can be cleared by you at any time through browser settings</li>
                <li>Other users of the same device can access this data</li>
                <li>Browser extensions may access localStorage data</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Your Data Rights</h2>
            <p>You have full control over your game data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view your stored data through browser developer tools</li>
                <li><strong>Modify:</strong> You can edit or delete specific data via developer tools</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can clear all game data at any time (see below)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally, we don't have access to it and therefore cannot modify or delete it for you.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Berserkdle does not use any third-party services that collect personal data. However, note that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our game is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may collect standard access logs</li>
                <li>We don't use cookies or any external tracking services</li>
                <li>If we add any third-party services in the future, we'll update this policy</li>
            </ul>
